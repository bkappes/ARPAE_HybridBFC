@article{Nair2012,
abstract = {Permeation through nanometer pores is important in the design of materials for filtration and separation techniques and because of unusual fundamental behavior arising at the molecular scale. We found that submicrometer-thick membranes made from graphene oxide can be completely impermeable to liquids, vapors, and gases, including helium, but these membranes allow unimpeded permeation of water (H(2)O permeates through the membranes at least 10(10) times faster than He). We attribute these seemingly incompatible observations to a low-friction flow of a monolayer of water through two-dimensional capillaries formed by closely spaced graphene sheets. Diffusion of other molecules is blocked by reversible narrowing of the capillaries in low humidity and/or by their clogging with water.},

@article{Paneri2014,
abstract = {Development of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) with insignificant methanol permeability at highly concentrated methanol supply is considered a major advancement in the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) technology. Here, we investigate the potential of graphene-based membranes for achieving this objective. A membrane is prepared through the lamination of graphene-oxide (GO) nanoplatelets and its transport characteristics are studied. The studies suggest that the membrane methanol permeation rate decreases linearly as the nanoplatelets size is increased, while proton conductivity changes rather insignificantly. The observed transport characteristics are attributed to either different adopted conduction pathways or surface mobility of protons and methanol molecules. The findings imply that the GO nanoplatelets contain atomic formations that are more selective to protons than to methanol molecules. Direct methanol fuel cell measurements of the membrane at high fuel concentrations showed almost no drop in the open circuit potential (OCP) and significant improvements in power density compared to that of a Nafion membrane. © 2014.},
