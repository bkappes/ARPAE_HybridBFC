<p><em>Opening Line</em> Since their inception 25 years ago, direct methanol fuel cells have struggled to live up to the promise of a renewable fuel source that carries ten times the energy density of compressed hydrogen and fifteen times that of lithium ion batteries. This is poised to change with developments in membrane and catalyst technologies.</p>
<p>Despite their strengths, all fuel cells -- including direct methanol -- suffer from intrinsic electrochemical limitations to their use as stand-alone power supplies. Sluggish kinetics and chemical, mass transport, and ohmic polarization losses impede their ability to promptly respond to changes in power demand and result in a narrow power band, respectively.</p>
<p>Where fuel cells fall short, batteries excel. Their ability to respond instantly to changing power demands and their wide power band, extending over several orders-of-magnitude in their operational C-rate, is a succor for the problems facing fuel cells. However, even state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries fall well short of the energy density available from methanol.</p>
<p>We propose a hybrid battery-fuel cell power system that joins the energy density and generation properties of a fuel cell with the power response of batteries; leveraging the strengths of the one in support of the weaknesses of the other.</p>
<p>Such a system also provides a certain flexibility in design. Under the paradigm of this hybrid power-system, the average power demand, <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">&lang;</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">power</mtext><mo stretchy="false">&rang;</mo><mo>&sdot;</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">duty cycle</mtext></mrow></math>, dictates the power capacity of the fuel cell, while deviation from this average dictates the capacity of the battery. Designs that minimize these fluctuations, and improvements in electrochemical energy storage serve to reduce the weight, and volume, of the battery: a volume that can be repurposed to provide more fuel. At fifteen times greater energy density, combining energy generation and energy storage leverages developments in either into a capacity multiplier.</p>
<!-- The choice of fuel cell and battery technologies are an optimization that requires careful consideration of application-specific demands. -->

<p>This project will focus on the low-to-mid-level power requirements of portable power, with near-term implications in the transportation (EV) market.</p>

<p>Although liquid hydrogen provides the largest gravimetric capacity, this is overshadowed by the balance of plant structures required for cryogenic storage (reference?). Methanol has a 75.5% higher energy density than cryogenic hydrogen and a negligible intrinsic requirement for fuel storage.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing manufacturing, distribution, and point-of-sale infrastructure can be easily, and incrementally, converted from gasoline/diesel to methanol. Hydrogen could not.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, (fraction?) methanol is produced by steam reforming methane (reference?). However unlike other higher order alcohols, technologies exist at a technological readiness level of XX for the commercial production of methanol from biomass. Thus, the use of methanol would result in the closed cycle production, distribution, and reclamation of carbon, resulting in a carbon-neutral fuel source.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, this work will focus on the integration of direct methanol fuel cells as the power generator.</p>
<h3 id="batteries">Batteries</h3>
<p>There are many energy storage options: lithium ion, magnesium ion, redox flow, supercapacitors. (Expand discussion on the down selection from these to lithium ion batteries.)</p>
<p>With volumetric energy densities between 256 and 394 Wh/L and specific energies between 86 and 147 Wh/kg,[(Arico2009)][Arico2009] lithium ion batteries have energy capacities and kinetics sufficient to handle fluctuations in power demands.</p>
<p>The use of liquid electrolytes in lithium ion battery chemistries increases the complexity of battery design and are involved in numerous unsafe redox reactions, particularly at overcharged and undercharged conditions. Solid state lithium ion batteries do not suffer from operational limitations that plague these chemistries.</p>
<p>A hybrid power systems ensures the battery remain within the broad window for optimal battery performance.</p>
<p>For these reasons, this work will focus on integration of solid state lithium ion batteries as the power storage medium.</p>
